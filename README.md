# Micropython Driver for ILI9341 display


2023-0901 update: I've tested and modified the driver and testprograms on a Raspberry PI PICO-W mounted on DFRobot Gravity Expansion board. Driver ili934xnew is extended with some methods, like drawing an image. Micropython v1.20.0 for Raspberry PI Pico-W.

This has been tested on an M5Stack module using the standard esp32 micropython port. The default font is the Adafruit glcdfont and additional fonts can be generated by a very slightly modified version of Peter Hinch's font-to-py program which includes a function in font file to return the pixel width of a string of characters.
